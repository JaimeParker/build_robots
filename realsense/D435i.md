[How-to: Getting IMU data from D435i and T265](https://www.intelrealsense.com/how-to-getting-imu-data-from-d435i-and-t265/)

The IMU sensor does not include internal calibration, which may manifest itself with non-zero angular velocities produced at idle mode and the gravity (accel) force measured being not equal to 9.80665 m/s2. In order to rectify those inaccuracies, the T265’s IMU sensor is calibrated in the production line.

For D435i the IMU sensor is not calibrated, hence a [free calibration tool](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/tools/rs-imu-calibration#rs-imu-calibration-tool) is available as as part of the SDK. Running the calibration routine will calculate IMU intrinsic covariance and zero offsets, and then store them on device’s NVRAM for later use in SDK. The depth<->IMU sensor extrinsic (rigid body transformation) is precalculated based on mechanical drawings and cannot be modified. When initialized, the SDK will query the device for the existence of the IMU calibration data, and if present – apply it to the raw IMU samples produced by the device.
